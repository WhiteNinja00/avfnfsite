    <h1>&nbsp;</h1>
    <h2>We've got a lot in store for this next update.</h2>
    <h2>For starters, almost every song from the last version is being remastered. Some by their original composers like Vengeance & Fallen, while other classics get remade by new faces like Repeater.</h2>
    <h2>In terms of new stuff, you won't be disappointed either. We have over 30 all new tracks, bringing the total song count to around 41! A lot of our songs have all new mechanics which adds extra challenge. With these new songs, we're trying to up the quality, spectacle, & overall create an experience that leaves V1 in the dust. That, and we have an intriguing story tying it all together.</h2>
