        <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
        <h3>Animation VS. Friday Night Funkin' (or AVFNF or even AVF for short), is a nonprofit Friday Night Funkin' mod about the works of Alan Becker & those inspired by him.</h3>
        <h3>This is the 2nd update to the full mod which released in October 2022, which came after the demo which released earlier that year.</h3>
        <h3>All characters & works used in the mod are creations of Alan Becker, Funkin' Crew, Mojang, etc.</h3>

        <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
        <h3>We've got a lot in store for this next update.</h3>
        <h3>For starters, almost every song from the last version is being remastered. Some by their original composers like Vengeance & Fallen, while other classics get remade by new faces like Repeater.</h3>
        <h3>In terms of new stuff, you won't be disappointed either. We have over 30 all new tracks, bringing the total song count to around 41! A lot of our songs have all new mechanics which adds extra challenge. With these new songs, we're trying to up the quality, spectacle, & overall create an experience that leaves V1 in the dust. That, and we have an intriguing story tying it all together.</h3>
        <h3>All in all, Episode 2 is set to be the ultimate Alan Becker Friday NIght Funkin' experience.</h3>
