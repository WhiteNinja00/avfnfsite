        "content": "Hey everyone! Itâ€™s JaceLOL, one of the directors for the mod! Itâ€™s been a hot minute since I was hired and BOYYYY did we get some juicy stuff done, such as this website made by White Ninja (the goat). In this post, I just wanted to answer some questions you guys may have and talk about some of the things that are to be expected with this update, so without further ado, letâ€™s get into it:<h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2>Q: What will be in AvFNF Episode 2?<h2>&nbsp;</h2>A: I canâ€™t reveal TOO much, however, it has been confirmed that the entire main week is getting remastered and there will be a week dedicated to episodes 25-30 of AVM Season 3 (which is where most of the songs I made will be :3). Other than that, youâ€™ll just have to wait and see :)<h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2>Q: When do you think the mod is releasing?<h2>&nbsp;</h2>A: If I had to guess personally, I'd say sometime around late 2025. We have a lot of stuff planned!<h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2>Q: What is your favorite song currently?<h2>&nbsp;</h2>A: Definitely Chosen V2. The people who remade it did a good job replicating the original, as well as making it sound better than before!<h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2>Q: What is your favorite part about development?<h2>&nbsp;</h2>A: Definitely studying and learning from other musicians. There are a lot of people who specialize in different genres and itâ€™s fun to study their music!<h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2>Q: Will there be anything related to AVA 9 or above?<h2>&nbsp;</h2>A: Sadly not, since all of the songs in the mod are connected in some way. Adding the lore of AVA 9 and above would not work out with the story, so other than Victimâ€™s songs, there wonâ€™t be any mentions of AVA 9+ in the mod. (sorry!)<h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2>Q: will hood irony be in the mod<h2>&nbsp;</h2>A: yeah man<h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2>Thatâ€™s all from me for now. Iâ€™ll post something else later on down the line, but until then, always pray to god and see you guys soon!"
